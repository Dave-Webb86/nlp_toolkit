# nlp_toolkit
This repository contains a toolkit of useful nlp functions which I often use, please feel free to use these functions in your work.

Each function is saved in a pythin notebook with explanatory text where required.

I try to reference each source that is used for each function so if using please be kind and credit the original sources
